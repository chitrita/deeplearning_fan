# deeplearning

In this repository, 

### I focus on 

1. Developing and comparing variational inference based deep learning methods for the purpose of multiple datasets integration

- Variational auto-encoder, Hyperspherical Variational Auto-Encoders, VampPrior variational auto-encoder

- Multi-CCA, Deep CCA, Deep variational CCA

2. Applying the developed methods to resovle the heterogeneity in large-scale immune and stroma cells. For example, single-cell RNA-seq.
