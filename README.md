# deeplearning

In this repository, I focus on 

### Developing and comparing variational inference based deep learning methods for the purpose of multiple datasets integration

#### Variational auto-encoder, Hyperspherical Variational Auto-Encoders, VampPrior variational auto-encoder

#### Multi-CCA, Deep CCA, Deep variational CCA

### Applying the developed methods to resovle the heterogeneity in large-scale immune and stroma cells. For example, single-cell RNA-seq.

### Resouce

Most of the knowledge that I am learning are from
