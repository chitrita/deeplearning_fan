### Focus of this repository

**Developing and comparing** variational inference based deep learning methods for the purpose of multiple datasets integration

- Variational auto-encoder, Hyperspherical Variational Auto-Encoders, VampPrior variational auto-encoder

- Multi-CCA, Deep CCA, Deep variational CCA

**Applying** the developed methods to resovle the heterogeneity in large-scale immune and stroma cells. For example, single-cell RNA-seq.
